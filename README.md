# FizzBuzz
My take on the popular tried and tested programming task using PHP

The program prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of three it prints "FIZZ" instead of the number and for multiples of five it prints "BUZZ". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five it prints "FIZZBUZZ".
